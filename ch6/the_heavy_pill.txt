The Heavy Pill

You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle. You can only use the scale once.

Seperate your piles into 2 divisions of 5 each. Take one pill out of each and the first 5 go on the left side and the other 5 go on the right.

The side that weighs more means that the pills are in that group.
Now replace one of the bottles from the other side that you know is
light with one from the group that weighs more.
If the other side now weighs more, you have your bottle.
Otherwise repeat.
