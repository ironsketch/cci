Dominos

There is an 8x8 chessboard inwhich two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exatly two squares.Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible)

First, when it says diagonally opposite corners, does not actually specifiy that it only cut off a square from the board. These corners can be of any size.

So then that leads to the question of how much can we cut that board and still cover it with dominos.

Mafff:
(8 * 8 - 2) / 2 = 31

It's not that simple because you have to lay out the dominos but it gives me an idea.

   X  [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
   [] [] [] [] [] [] []  X

To solve this progamatically I would use a backtracking algorithm

But without that take notice that the lines on the outside are not even so you will need to manipulate the placement of the dominos.

    X  d  [d d] [d d] [d d]
    D  d  [d d] [d d] D  d
    D  [d d] d  [d d] D  d
    d  D  [] d  [] D  d  D
    d  D  [] [] [] D  d  D
    D  d  [] [] [] d  D  d
    D  d  [] [] [] d  D  d
    [d d] [] [] [] [d d] X

    It may not be possible!
