Jugs of water

You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Fill the 3-quart jug
Pour it into the 5-quart jug
Fill the 3-quart jug
Fill the 5-quart jug leaving 1 quart left in the 3-quart jug
Toss what is in the 5-quart jug
Pour the 1 quart into the 5-quart jug
Fill the 3-quart jug
Pour that into the 5-quart jug
Voila easy
