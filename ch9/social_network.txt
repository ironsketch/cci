Social Network

How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or Linkedin? Describe how you would design an algotrithm to show the shortedt path between two people (e.g. Me->Bob->Susan->Jason->You).

Database for users and passwords.

                            ________
                           |  USER  | -> Post, comment, react etc.
                            --------
                            ||
                            _________
                           | Generic | -> Edit their own profile
                           |  Member |
                            ---------
                            ||
                            ___________
                           | Moderator | -> moderate posts, comments
                            -----------
                            ||
                            _______
                           | Admin | -> edit other profiles, delete users
                            -------


When I think of shortest path I think of Wordnet that uses a datastructure to find relatable words.

This would be a directed graph that could be cyclical.

Using a stack I could check breadth first for connections.
