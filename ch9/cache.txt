Cache

Imagine a web server for a simplfied search engine. This system has 100 machines to respond to search queries, which may then call out using processSearch(string query) to another cluster of machines to actually get the result. The machine which responds to a given query is chosen at random, so you cannot gaurantee that the same machine will always respond to the same request. The method procesSearch is very expensive. Design a caching mechanism for the most recent queries.
Be sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.

You can have set up many caches. Depending on search frequency and results clicked on you can hold in closer caches the most frequently used. Like when you search Facebook on Google, Facebook.com is the first link then probably relevant news articles are next. Google probably has caches for each category now that you can control what TYPE of search you are doing, video, images, news, etc.
